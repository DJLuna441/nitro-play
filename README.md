# nitro-play

nitro-play is a web-based music player, visualizer and exporter for sequenced music files on the Nintendo DS in the SDAT format. Check it out [here](https://danielpxl.github.io/nitro-play). You will need a relatively modern web browser to use it.

Keep in mind that not every song will sound perfect, since not all features of the DS's sound hardware are properly implemented. However, most songs should sound pretty good. See [nitro-fs](https://github.com/DanielPXL/nitro-fs) for more details on the player.
